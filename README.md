# ScheduleGenerator

A powerful Angular application for generating and managing schedules efficiently.

## Features

- Easy schedule creation and management
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Customizable time slots
- Export to multiple formats
- Responsive design

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm (version 9 or higher)
- Angular CLI (version 19.0.0)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/schedule_generator.git
cd schedule_generator
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Build options

- `ng build --prod` - for production build
- `ng build --watch` - for development with auto-rebuild
- `ng build --configuration=staging` - for staging environment

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
